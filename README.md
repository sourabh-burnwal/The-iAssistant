# The iAssistant
This repo consists of the project I did in my winter training-cum-internship

The project consists of two parts. One of them will be the client, supposingly the admin. First he will be verified by face 
recognition. Then, he can do following things on any number of systems he wants with just by saying :
 - Install httpd and docker
 - Flushing firewall
 - Installing hadoop and deploying a hadoop multinode cluster
 - deploying a web server
 - accessing the webcam of any system, click a photo and bring it to him
 
Technologies used :
 - Networking
 - Linux commands
 - Docker
 - Ansible

Scripts in bin folder has to be in /bin folder in server system and have to be made executable by using chmod command. All the other files and folders except client program have to be on server side as well. One needs to put the IPs and passwords of the systems one wants to deploy everything on. One also needs to edit the paths according to his system.
